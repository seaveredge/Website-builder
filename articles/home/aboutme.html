  <p>
    My name is Chris Verhoek, and I'm currently working as a PhD candidate in the Control Systems group (Dept. of Electrical Engineering) at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). I'm working on <i>data-based analysis and control of nonlinear systems with stability and performance guarantees</i>, closely together with my promotor <a href="https://rolandtoth.eu" target="_blank">Roland To&#769th</a> and co-promotor <a href="https://www.sofiehaesaert.com" target="_blank">Sofie Haesaert</a>. This can of course be approached from both a broad and narrow perspective, so let me specify a bit further! During my PhD trajectory, I'm focusing on two research lines: (i) data-driven analysis and control of Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems using <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sysconle.2004.09.003" target="_blank">Willems' Fundamental Lemma</a> (see <a href="https://research.chrisverhoek.com/#publications" target="_blank">my papers</a> on the topic), and (ii) learning-based model-augmentation using linear fractional represented artificial neural networks and a priori known first-principles models (see, e.g., <a href="https://research.chrisverhoek.com/#pubblux2022" target="_blank">this abstract</a>). So, very exciting topics! You can find more details on my research <a href="https://research.chrisverhoek.com" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/chris-verhoek" target="_blank">here,</a> or <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=L4Nj_QkAAAAJ" target="_blank">here</a>.

    Next to my love for exciting research, I'm also very much into hiking (see my <a href="https://personal.chrisverhoek.com/#iceland2021" target="_blank">blog</a> on my experiences during the Laugavegur trail), <a href="https://youtu.be/iHrag0xkAsE" target="_blank">jazz drumming</a> and the <i>art</i> of mathematics (see for example <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/733754/visually-stunning-math-concepts-which-are-easy-to-explain"  target="_blank">a beautiful thread</a>).
