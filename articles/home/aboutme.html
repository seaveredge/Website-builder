  About me

<section>
  <p>
    My name is Chris Verhoek, and I'm currently working as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Pennsylvania on the topic of Control Architecture Theory. I'm working closely together with <a href="https://nikolaimatni.github.io" target="_blank">prof. Nikolai Matni</a>'s group in the Electrical and Systems Engineering department. In May 2025, I obtained my PhD from the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) with <b>Cum Laude</b><sup style="font-size:70%;"><a href="#cumlaudefootnote">§</a></sup> distinction, which I'm very happy with. My PhD work was on <i>data-based analysis and control of nonlinear systems with stability and performance guarantees</i>, and my promotors were <a href="https://rolandtoth.eu" target="_blank">Roland To&#769th</a> and <a href="https://www.sofiehaesaert.com" target="_blank">Sofie Haesaert</a>. My PhD topic can of course be approached from both a broad and narrow perspective, so let me specify a bit further: I focused on two research lines: (i) data-driven analysis and control of Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems using <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sysconle.2004.09.003" target="_blank">Willems' Fundamental Lemma</a> (see <a href="https://research.chrisverhoek.com/#publications" target="_blank">my papers</a> on the topic), and (ii) learning-based model-augmentation using linear fractional represented artificial neural networks and a priori known first-principles models (see, e.g., <a href="https://research.chrisverhoek.com/#pubblux2022" target="_blank">this abstract</a>). You can find more details on my research <a href="https://research.chrisverhoek.com" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/chris-verhoek" target="_blank">here,</a> or <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=L4Nj_QkAAAAJ" target="_blank">here</a>.

    Next to my love for exciting research, I'm also very much into climbing, hiking (see my <a href="https://personal.chrisverhoek.com/#iceland2021" target="_blank">blog</a> on my experiences during the Laugavegur trail), <a href="https://youtu.be/iHrag0xkAsE" target="_blank">jazz drumming</a> and the <i>art</i> of mathematics (see for example <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/733754/visually-stunning-math-concepts-which-are-easy-to-explain"  target="_blank">a beautiful thread</a>).
