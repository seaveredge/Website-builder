<h2>Academic background</h2>
<section>
  <p>
    I obtained my BSc. degree in Mechatronics from the Avans University of Applied Sciences Breda in 2017, and my MSc degree in Systems and Control from the TU/e (cum laude) in 2020. During my MSc research, I worked on incremental dissipativity based analysis and control of nonlinear systems, and on a novel performance shaping framework for nonlinear systems. The research was carried out in the Control Systems group at the TU/e, under supervision of Roland To&#769th and Patrick Koelewijn. <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/incremental-dissipativity-analysis-of-nonlinear-systems-using-the" target="_blank">My MSc thesis</a> was selected as the best thesis of the year 2020 within the Electrical Engineering department. After my MSc graduation, I worked for 6 months as a University Researcher at the TU/e, prior to my PhD trajectory that started in February 2021.
