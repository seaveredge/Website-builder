		Building this website has been a bit of a journey. In this blog post, I will take you along this journey (as far as I remember things) and hopefully give you some useful tips in case you want to go for the same challenge as I went for. From starting with a site-builder like HUGO, to writing it yourself using classic HTML, figuring out how the heck you get it online and eventually building my own site-builder. <a href="content/website.html">Read it here</a>, enjoy!
