		In 2023, me and my significant other (Kaya) went on a hiking trip to Gran Canaria, hiking from north to south. In this extensive blog post I report on the adventures we encountered day by day. From getting lost, to life-changing events and horrifying animal noises, all is passing by! For every day, Kaya also made a vlog that you can watch on YouTube (Dutch, but English subtitles). <a href="content/grancanaria.html">Read it here</a>, enjoy!
