		During the summer of 2021, just after the Netherlands was released from lockdown, we (my partner Kaya, friend Thomas and me) went on a hiking trip in Iceland. In this blog post, I take you along the days of our itinerary. We come across colorful mountains, boiling puddles and a million waterfalls. Not <i>only</i> words cannot describe the natural beauty we encountered, so I made sure to include enough pictures ;-). <a href="content/iceland.html">Read it here</a>, enjoy!
